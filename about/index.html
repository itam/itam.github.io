<div class="aboutMe content">
    <p>
        What do I do? As much as I may want to believe, I’m not a professional web surfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m not a designer (despite how much I’d like to be) nor am I a professional artist. In fact, I'm all self
        taught and haven’t even had any formal art training. Even though I won’t be submitting any resumes to Blizzard
        or Dreamworks (Okay, maybe I tried once or twice before...) I've been drawing since before I can remember.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m actually a software developer. Most of the time I don’t do anything flashy (I really hope to some day…)
        and sometimes some problems can be a real headache, but it's been a hell of a journey so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my off time I like to cook, and since I can't remember everything that I've done I've taken to writing recipes
        down (in case you were wondering why there's a random food link in the navigation...)

<div class="aboutTheSite content">
    <p>
        This site (formerly VRhapsody.com) has gone through several major revisions since the late 90's and has
        incorporated technologies such as PHP, MySQL, and Wordpress. In its current incarnation, it has been
        stripped down to the bare minimum; I've coded this entire site in VIM using HTML, CSS and Jekyll hosted on
        Github Pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site is and probably will continue to be a work in progress. It is a place for me to experiment, observe,
        and interact with different kinds of concepts and technologies and I'm always changing and (hopefully)
        improving. After all, an artist's work is never truly done, is it?
